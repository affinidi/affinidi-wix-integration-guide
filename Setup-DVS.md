5. Click Save to apply the redirect rule, This will ensure that when someone visits e.g. https://parameshk9.wixsite.com/.well-known/did.json, they will be redirected to the new URL where your `did.json` is hosted.

6. We can test the redirection by clicking on `View redirect` button
  
    **Note**: 301 redirections won't work without custom domains
